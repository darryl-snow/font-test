Hello!

Paste something in the top left.

If you want to test for unsupported characters, then delete any numbers, spaces, 
or roman letters (punctuation is ok). Any characters that are supported by the 
font will turn red in the section on the top right.

Under headlines there are 3 boxes. Inside is how the text you pasted will appear on desktop, tablet, and mobile, from left to right, respectively. Same with Copy below that.
